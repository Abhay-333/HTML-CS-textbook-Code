    Padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.

    CSS positioning- it allows us to set the position of the html element inside the html page. There r 5 types of CSS positioning 
    1.static -this is the default position property for html element. In this property, html elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties have no effect on static.
    2.relative - In this property, html elements are positioned according to the normal flow of hte document similar to static. But u can use top, bottom, and left properties in relative posoitioning.
    3.fixed - An element with a fixed position is displayed with respect to the browser window, also known as the viewport. If u set the position:fixed, then the html element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the html element in the page layout. It supports the  top, bottom, left, adn right properties of CSS.
    4.absolute - An element with position:absolut; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. The html element is removed from the normal document flow. It supports the top, bottom, left, right properties of CSS.
    5.sticky - Sticky element is hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" to a place (like position: fixed).

    Html entities are reserved text that starts with &(ampersand) and ends with a (;) semicolon.

    Float- CSS float property places an element on the left or right side of its parent element, allowing text or inline elements to wrap around it.
    A floated html element is positioned within the normal flow of the html document, then it is taken out of the flow and shifted to the left or right
    clear -Sometimes float elements overlapped a given element for that purpose we use clear property to clear the space.It dosnt allow any float element to enter in it. 

    Media query- ucan set the different styles for ur webpage on a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop and this works based on the screen size, device type, or orientation of the device.
